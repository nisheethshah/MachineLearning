Data Analysis Algorithms with Train and Test Data

-	Developing a regression algorithm and a cross-validation technique that will be used to select the models with the most effective complexity - KNN and L-fold Cross-Validation.
-	Use of bootstrapping technique to quantify the uncertainty of predictions.
-	Regularisations - Find L1/L2 norms to a given gradient descent algorithm for linear regression. Compare SGD/BGD determinations of ridge regression. Bias-Variance Analysis of ridge regression.
-	Gauge Multiclass Perceptron.
